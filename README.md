    Player.java 
    League.java

About the Program:

This program contains three classes: a Player Class, a League Class, and a LeagueDriver Class.
The LeagueDriver is the driver and contains the main. It takes in a file name as a command line
argument. The file has a list of basketball players, their team names, and also the number of 
points they have scored in total. The LeagueDriver saves each player name into an array of type league
by using a scanner and scanning over each line individually. The number of players is counted and scores are 
averaged. Once in the League class, it is saved as a Player object and put into a list. 
At the of the main, the list of the players is printed out using 
method printLeague() found in LeagueClass and method printAverage() found in LeagueClass.
